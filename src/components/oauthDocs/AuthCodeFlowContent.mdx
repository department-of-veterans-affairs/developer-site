### Initiating the Authorization Code Flow {tabIndex="-1" #authorization-code-flow}

**NOTE:** We provide a sample [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application for demonstrating how to get up and running with our OAuth system. You can find the complete source code for it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/oauth_node).

Begin the OpenID Connect authorization by using the authorization endpoint, query parameters, and scopes listed below.

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```
https://sandbox-api.va.gov{{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/authorization?
  client_id=0oa1c01m77heEXUZt2p7
  &redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
  &response_type=code
  &scope={{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.scopes.join(' ') ?? 'profile openid offline_access'}}
  &state=1AOQK33KIfH2g0ADHvU1oWAb7xQY7p6qWnUFiG1ffcUdrbCY1DBAZ3NffrjaoBGQ
  &nonce=o5jYpLSe29RBHBsn5iAnMKYpYw2Iw9XRBweacc001hRo5xxJEbHuniEbhuxHfVZy
```

</CodeWrapper>

| Query Parameter | Required     | Values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `client_id`     | **Required** | The `client_id` issued by the VA API Platform team |
| `redirect_uri`  | **Required** | The URL you supplied. The user will be redirected to this URL after authorizing your application. |
| `response_type` | **Required** | Supported response types: `code` |
| `state`         | **Required** | Ensures authorization flow integrity. |
| `scope`         | **Required** | Will use your application's default scopes unless you specify a smaller subset of scopes separated by a space. Review the <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#scopes' }}>Scopes section</HashLink> for more information. |
| `nonce`         | Optional     | <p>Using a `nonce` with JWTs prevents some kinds of replay attacks where a malicious party can attempt to resend an `id_token` request in order to impersonate a user of your application.</p><p>A nonce should be generated on a per-session basis and stored on the user's client. If the user requested an id_token (by including the openid scope in the authorization request) then the <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#payload' }}>payload of the id_token</HashLink> will contain a nonce value that should match the nonce value included in the authorization request.</p><p>The [OpenID Connect documentation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NonceNotes) offers the following suggestion for generating nonces:</p><p>The nonce parameter value needs to include per-session state and be unguessable to attackers. One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is to store a cryptographically random value as an HttpOnly session cookie and use a cryptographic hash of the value as the nonce parameter. In that case, the nonce in the returned ID Token is compared to the hash of the session cookie to detect ID Token replay by third parties. A related method applicable to JavaScript Clients is to store the cryptographically random value in HTML5 local storage and use a cryptographic hash of this value. </p> |
| `prompt`        | Optional     | <p>Supported prompts: `login`, `consent` and `none`.</p><p>If `login` is specified, the user will be forced to provide credentials regardless of session state. If omitted, an existing active session with the identity provider may not require the user to provide credentials.</p><p>If `consent` is specified, the user will be asked to consent to their scopes being used regardless of prior consent.</p><p>If `none` is specified, an application will attempt an authorization request without user interaction. When the session is invalid or there are scopes the user has not consented to, one of the following errors will be thrown: `login_required` or `consent_required`.</p> |

The Veteran will need to grant your application access permission. To do this, direct the Veteran to the URL above. The Veteran is taken through an authentication flow by VA.gov and asked to consent to your application accessing their data. The data that can be accessed is defined by your scopes. After the Veteran gives permission, your application will receive a response based on the `response_type` you requested.

#### Authorization Code Grant {#authorization-code-grant}

After a Veteran gives authorization for you to access their data, their browser will be redirected to your application with the response shown below, which returns the `code` and `state` parameters you must use to make a request to our authorization service. We require the state parameter for all authorization code grant flows.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: <yourRedirectURL>?
  code=z92dapo5
  &state=af0ifjsldkj
```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the following format, in HTTP basic authentication, for your request using the returned code and state parameters.

- Use your client ID and client secret as the HTTP basic authentication username and password.
- Be sure to replace `<yourRedirectURL>` with the redirect URL that you provided during registration.

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic { base64 encoded *client_id* + ':' + *client_secret* }

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=z92dapo5&state=af0ifjsldkj
&redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
```

</CodeWrapper>

The authorization server will respond with an <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#id-token' }}>access token</HashLink>. If you requested the `offline_access` scope, you will also receive a `refresh_token`. The response will look like this:

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
    "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
    "scope": "{{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.scopes.join(' ') ?? 'profile openid offline_access'}}",
    "patient": "1558538470",
    "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

If an error occurs, you will instead receive a response like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
    "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the returned `access_token` to authorize requests to our platform by including it in the header of HTTP requests as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`.

**NOTE:** the <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#id-token' }}>access token</HashLink> will only work for the API and scopes for which you have previously initiated authorization. If you need additional scopes in the future, you will need to build a new authorization URL with the additional scopes and have the Veteran grant consent again.

Use the `refresh_token` to obtain a new `access_token` after its expiry by sending the following request.

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic { base64 encoded *client_id* + ':' + *client_secret* }

token={ *refresh_token* }&token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

The response will return a new `access_token` and `refresh_token`, if you requested the `offline_access` scope.

#### Manage Account {#manage-account}

The manage endpoint directs end users to a URL where they can view which applications currently have access to their data and can make adjustments to these access rights (grants).

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/manage HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
```

</CodeWrapper>

#### Revoking Tokens {#revoking-tokens}

Clients may revoke their own `access_tokens` and `refresh_tokens` using the revoke endpoint. Once revoked, the introspection endpoint will see the token as inactive.

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic { base64 encoded *client_id* + ':' + *client_secret* }

token={ *access_token* }&token_type_hint=access_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic { base64 encoded *client_id* + ':' + *client_secret* }

token={ *refresh_token* }&token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

#### Revoking Grants {#revoking-grants}

**NOTE:** This endpoint is not available in the production environment and excludes identity provider grants.

A user will be prompted only once to consent to each client's use of their data. Such a grant will remain in effect unless and until revoked. Grants for a specific user and client are revoked in the sandbox environment using the below endpoint.

<APISelector options={ props.options } selectedOption={ props.selectedOption } />
<CodeWrapper>

```http
DELETE {{props.apiDef?.oAuthInfo?.baseAuthPath ?? '/oauth2/{api}/v1'}}/grants HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id={client_id}&email={test account email}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The client ID is your application client ID (`client_id`) and the email is the user’s email, which must be passed into the body of the request. Bad requests will be returned with an error response and description of the error.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
    "error": "invalid_request",
    "error_description": "Invalid email address."
}
```

</CodeWrapper>
