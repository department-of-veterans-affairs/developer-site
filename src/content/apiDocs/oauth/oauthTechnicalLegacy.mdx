## Getting Started {tabIndex="-1"}

The VA API Platform uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard to allow Veterans to authorize third-party applications to access data on their behalf. The platform also allows some users, such as officers working at Veteran Service Organizations (VSO), to access data on behalf of a Veteran who has granted them approval.

While we test our OpenID Connect flow to ensure the best experience for Veterans, developers, and other users, we're approving teams to work with our OpenID Connect and associated APIs on a case-by-case basis. If you would like to help us build these services out, please submit an [application](/apply) to request access.

**In order to get approval of your application, you'll need to supply the following information:**

- **A Redirect URL** - that will receive your OpenID Connect token
- **Application name** - The name and/or URL of your application that identifies it on authorization screens.
- **Type of Application** - Mobile app, Single page web application, or a Server-based application
- **Scopes** - Data you'd like to access with your app (see [#scopes](#scopes))

## Building OpenID Connect Applications {tabIndex="-1"}

After being approved to use VA OpenID Connect, you'll receive a _client id_ and, if you're building a server-based application, a _client secret_.

We support [Authorization Code Flow](#authorization-code-flow) with a _client secret_ and [Proof Key for Code Exchange](#proof-key-for-code-exchange) (PKCE) for public apps.

We use separate authorization servers for our development and production environments. This documentation uses the development environment authorization server URL. You'll be provided with the production authorization server URL when you are approved for production access.

### Authorization Code Flow

This flow is used by applications that are able to safely store a _client secret_ such as server-based applications.

#### Initiating Authorization

Initiate the OpenID Connect authorization by directing your application's users to

<CodeWrapper>

```
https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/authorization
```

</CodeWrapper>

with the following query parameters:

| Query Parameter | Required     | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `state`         | **Required** | Ensures authorization flow integrity. See [security](#security-considerations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `nonce`         | Optional     | Used with `id_token` to verify token integrity. Ensure the nonce in your `id_token` is the same as this value. See [security](#security-considerations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `response_mode` | Optional     | Either `fragment` or `query`, recommended not to use unless you have a specific reason. Defaults to fragment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `scope`         | Optional     | Will use your application's default scopes unless you specify a smaller subset of scopes separated by a space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `prompt`        | Optional     | Supported prompts: `login`, `consent` and `none`.<p>If `login` is specified, the user will be forced to provide credentials regardless of session state. If omitted, an existing active session with the identity provider may not require the user to provide credentials.</p><p>If `consent` is specified, the user will be asked to consent to their scopes being used regardless of prior consent.</p><p>If `none` is specified, an application will attempt an authorization request without user interaction. When the session is invalid or there are scopes the user has not consented to, one of the following errors will be thrown: `login_required` or `consent_required`.</p> |

Example Authorization URL:

<CodeWrapper>

```
https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/authorization?
  client_id=0oa1c01m77heEXUZt2p7
  &redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
  &response_type=code
  &scope=openid offline_access profile email veteran_status.read launch/patient
  &state=1AOQK33KIfH2g0ADHvU1oWAb7xQY7p6qWnUFiG1ffcUdrbCY1DBAZ3NffrjaoBGQ&nonce=o5jYpLSe29RBHBsn5iAnMKYpYw2Iw9XRBweacc001hRo5xxJEbHuniEbhuxHfVZy
```

</CodeWrapper>

(⚠️Be sure to replace `<yourRedirectURL>` with the redirect URL that you provided during registration)

The user will be taken through a flow where they are authenticated by VA.gov and then asked to consent to allowing your application access to the data it is requesting (as defined by your scopes). After authorizing, your application will receive a response based on the `response_type` you requested.

#### Authorization Code Grant

After the user confirms they want to authorize your application to access their data, their browser will be redirected to your application with a request like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```
GET <yourRedirectURL>?
  code=z92dapo5
  &state=af0ifjsldkj
Host: <yourRedirectHost>
```

</CodeWrapper>

Your application then makes a request to our authorization service using the returned `code` and `state` parameters. The request should use HTTP Basic authorization with your _client id_ as the username and your _client secret_ as the password. Your request should look like:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

grant_type=authorization_code&code=z92dapo5&state=af0ifjsldkj&redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
```

</CodeWrapper>

(⚠️Be sure to replace `<yourRedirectURL>` with the redirect URL that you provided during registration)

The authorization server will respond with an access token. If you requested the `offline_access` scope, you will also receive a `refresh_token`. The response will look like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "patient": "1558538470",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

If an error occurs, you will instead receive a response like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The resulting `access_token` can be used to authorize requests to the VA API Platform by including it in HTTP requests to the Platform by included it in the `Authorization` header as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`.

The `refresh_token` can be used to obtain a new `access_token` after its expiry by sending the following request.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your refresh_token}&scope={space separated scopes}
```

</CodeWrapper>

You will receive the same kind of response as above and be able to use your new `access_token` normally.

#### Revoking Tokens

Both `access_tokens` and `refresh_tokens` can be revoked using the following endpoint. Once revoked, the introspection endpoint will see the token as inactive.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

token={your access token}&token_type_hint=access_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

token={your refresh token}&token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

Clients may only revoke their own tokens.

#### Revoking Grants

A user will only be prompted once to consent to each client's use of their data, and the grants will remain in effect unless revoked. Revoke grants for a specified user and client in the Sandbox environment with the following endpoint:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
DELETE /oauth2/grants HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id={client_id}&email={test account email}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The user's email address (test account email) and application client ID (client_id) must be passed into the body of the request. Bad requests will be returned with an error response and description of the error.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "Invalid email address."
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

**Note:** This endpoint is not available in the Production environment and excludes identity provider grants.

#### Manage Account

The manage endpoint directs end users to a URL where they can view which applications currently have access to their data and can make adjustments to these access rights (grants).

<CodeWrapper>

```http
GET /oauth2/manage HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
```

</CodeWrapper>

### Proof Key for Code Exchange

The PKCE flow ([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) is used by public applications that are unable to safely store a _client secret_ such as a native mobile app.

#### Initiating Authorization

Initiate the OpenID Connect authorization by directing your application's users to

<CodeWrapper>

```
https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/authorization
```

| `prompt`                | Optional     | Supported prompts: `login`, `consent` and `none`.<p>If `login` is specified, the user will be forced to provide credentials regardless of session state. If omitted, an existing active session with the identity provider may not require the user to provide credentials.</p><p>If `consent` is specified, the user will be asked to consent to their scopes being used regardless of prior consent.</p><p>If `none` is specified, an application will attempt an authorization request without user interaction. When the session is invalid or there are scopes the user has not consented to, one of the following errors will be thrown: `login_required` or `consent_required`.</p> |

Example Authorization URL:

<CodeWrapper>

```
https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/authorization?
  client_id=0oa1c01m77heEXUZt2p7
  &response_type=code
  &scope=openid profile email patient/DiagnosticReport.read
  &redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
  &state=499f_073a_5094_fd7a_ff7f_0bf0_69e4_adad_2bdf_e3ab_76b9
  &code_challenge_method=S256
  &code_challenge=gNL3Mve3EVRsiFq0H6gfCz8z8IUANboT-eQZgEkXzKw
```

</CodeWrapper>

(⚠️Be sure to replace `<yourRedirectURL>` with the redirect URL that you provided during registration)

The user will be taken through a flow where they are authenticated by VA.gov and then asked to consent to allowing your application access to the data it is requesting (as defined by your scopes). After authorizing, your application will receive an authorization code.

#### Authorization Code Grant

After the user confirms they want to authorize your application to access their data, their browser will be redirected to your application with a request like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```
GET <yourRedirectURL>?
  code=z92dapo5
  &state=af0ifjsldkj
Host: <yourRedirectHost>
```

</CodeWrapper>

Your application then makes a request to our authorization service using the returned `code` and `state` parameters, along with the `code_verifier` used to create the `code_challenge` in the previous step.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=z92dapo5&state=af0ifjsldkj&redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>&code_verifier=ccec_bace_d453_e31c_eb86_2ad1_9a1b_0a89_a584_c068_2c96
```

</CodeWrapper>

(⚠️Be sure to replace `<yourRedirectURL>` with the redirect URL that you provided during registration)

The authorization server will respond with an access token. If you requested the `offline_access` scope, you will also receive a `refresh_token`. The response will look like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

If an error occurs, you will instead receive a response like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The resulting `access_token` can be used to authorize requests to the VA API Platform by including it in HTTP requests to the Platform by included it in the `Authorization` header as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`.

The `refresh_token` can be used to obtain a new `access_token` after its expiry by sending the following request.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your refresh_token}&client_id={client_id}&scope={space separated scopes}
```

</CodeWrapper>

You will receive the same kind of response as above and be able to use your new `access_token` normally.

## Scopes {tabIndex="-1"}

Scopes define the API endpoint your application is allowed to access. The VA API Platform team will define a maximum set of scopes your application is allowed to request. You can always begin an authorization flow by requesting fewer permissions that your application is allowed to access, which may result in more pleasant experience for users unsure if they should grant your application access to their data. You can then always request additional access to additional data when your application needs additional data for a Veteran or VSO using your application.

**Existing Scopes are:**

| Scope                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

These are subject to change while the VA API Platform OpenID Connect feature is under development.

## ID Token {tabIndex="-1"}

Unlike the access token returned by an authorization_code grant, which is simply a random value, an `id_token` is a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io) or JWT. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. This provides an extremely brief overview of a JWT. An `id_token` is available in the authorization code flow (response_type = code) token response when the 'openid' scope is used.

### Header

The JWT's header has two fields `alg` and `kid`. `alg` indicates the algorithm that was used the sign the JWT, and `kid` identifies the key that was used to sign the JWT. Signing keys and associated metadata are accessible from `https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

### Payload

The payload is a JSON object containing `claims`.

There are a couple claims in the JWT that are important for your application to consider:

- `nonce` - should match the `nonce` you initiated authorization with.
- `exp` - the expiration time of the JWT. The token cannot be accepted by the VA API Platform after this time, and your application should not use an expired token to identify a user.

The payload also contains claims about the user. Our JWTs will have the following fields:

- `uid` - A unique identifier for the user in UUIDv4 format.

### Signature

The signature is a cryptographically generated signature of the JWT's header and payload used to confirm the JWT's authenticity. Your application must validate this signature using the `alg` and the `kid` from the JWT's header. You may want use one of the JWT libraries listed at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to help make this process easier.

## Test Users {tabIndex="-1"}

While developing and testing your application, you'll need to be able to login. Since most of the data provided from the VA API Platform comes from internal VA systems, you can't sign up for an account and find useful data in it. We provide [test accounts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts.md) for you to use while developing your VA API Platform-based application.

Test user data is reset regularly.

## Security Considerations {tabIndex="-1"}

While some security concerns have been noted in this document, there are a few things application developers should take extra care to pay attention to when using VA OAuth.

### HTTPS

Outside of local development environments, all authorization callbacks must use the `https` protocol for communication. The `https` protocol provides a secure encrypted connection between the user's client, your application, and the VA API Platform and authorization servers. This mitigates the risk of some types of man-in-the-middle attacks and prevents third-parties from intercepting user's authorization credentials.

Additionally, the VA API Platform team requires your application to use secure ciphers and versions of the underlying SSL/TLS protocol.

### state

Specifying a `state` param helps protect against some classes of Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, and applications should include it. The `state` param will be passed back from the authorization server to your redirect URL unchanged, and your application should verify that it has the expected value. This helps assure that the client receiving the authorization response is the same as the client that initiated the authorization process.

### nonce

Using a `nonce` with JWTs prevents some kinds of replay attacks where a malicious party can attempt to resend an `id_token` request in order to impersonate a user of your application.

A nonce should be generated on a per-session basis and stored on the user's client.

The [OpenID Connect documentation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NonceNotes) offers the following suggestion for generating nonces:

> The nonce parameter value needs to include per-session state and be unguessable to attackers. One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is to store a cryptographically random value as an HttpOnly session cookie and use a cryptographic hash of the value as the nonce parameter. In that case, the nonce in the returned ID Token is compared to the hash of the session cookie to detect ID Token replay by third parties. A related method applicable to JavaScript Clients is to store the cryptographically random value in HTML5 local storage and use a cryptographic hash of this value.

### JWT Signature validation

Your application must validate JWT signatures. This allows your application to verify that the provided JWT originates from our authorization servers and prevents your application from accepting a JWT with claims that are attempting to impersonate one of your users.

## Support {tabIndex="-1"}

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to the VA API Platform team at [api@va.gov](mailto:api@va.gov). If you would like to report a bug or make a feature request, please open an issue through our [Support page](https://developer.va.gov/support).

## Sample Applications {tabIndex="-1"}

### Authorization Code Flow

We provide a sample [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application for demonstrating how to get up and running with our OAuth system. You can find the complete source code for it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/oauth_node).

### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

We also provide a [sample CLI application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/oauth_pkce_cli) for getting started using PKCE.
